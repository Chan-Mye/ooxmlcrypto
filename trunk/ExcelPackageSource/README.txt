Excel Package
http://excelpackage.codeplex.com/

Excellent wrapper for Excel 2007. GPL license.

Original source modified minimally to support passing in a Stream 
(in order to use OfficeOpenXmlCrypto.OfficeCryptoStream)

Cannot submit a patch to codeplex (code is available for download but
not checked in). Project is apparently dormant since Jan 2007 (2+ years), 
so no choice except to branch.
